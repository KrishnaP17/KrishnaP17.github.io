        <ol style="text-align: left;">
            <li><b>Submission leads to the right page:</b> The submission leads straight to the page, not to the personal website first- at least the link that was shared in the excel.</li> <br>
            <li><b>There are no spaces or upper-cases in the file/folder names: </b>There aren't any wrong spaces.</li> <br>
            <li><b>Page has sufficient contrast:</b> Page contrast was perfect mixture of the same color scheme but opposite shades.  </li> <br>
            <li><b>Page has site colors and fonts using standard .css file:</b>The page's color scheme is beautiful and light, I would say decrease the font size a little bit and maybe surround the text in cool borders to add more design, pattern, and alignment on you're page like you've done with other images.  </li><br>
            <li><b>Contrast:</b>The contrast is buoyant and light, I like it</li> <br>
            <li><b>Repetition:</b> There is repetition of font style, layout, and color. I would say add some more patterns around the screen to remove or enhance some blank spaces and repeated patterns would look great on your theme.  </li><br>
            <li><b>Alignment:</b> Overall alignment is good but the "about me" and "season" tab on the pages need to be margined off from the left edge a little. </li><br>
            <li><b>Proximity:</b> Proximity is awesome, I really love the navbar and the following components are in a decent range too. </li><br>
            <li><b>Page has header, main, footer:</b> yes</li><br>
            <li><b>Head, header, vs heading difference:</b> It is missing the brand/company name as the header</li><br>
            <li><b>Page has brand tagline somewhere:</b> The page doesn't have a tagline. </li><br>
            <li><b>Footer: </b> footer is great! I'd suggest centering the text and including copyright. Also I love the seasons tabs, it's creative :)</li><br>
