                    <h4>REAR VIEW MIRROR</h4>
                    <p>The rear view mirror is an essential safety feature that allows the driver to see what's happening behind the car without turning around. <br><br>
                        It reflects the view from the rear of the car, helping the driver to monitor traffic conditions and vehicles approaching from behind.</p>

                    <h4>HEADLIGHTS</h4>
                    <p>Description: Headlights are front-facing lights that illuminate the road ahead during low-light conditions or at night. <br><br>
                       They improve visibility for the driver and enhance the car's visibility to other road users, contributing to safety and navigation.</p>

                    <h4>SIDE MIRRORS</h4>
                    <p>Side mirrors, also known as wing mirrors, provide visibility to the sides and rear of the car, enhancing situational awareness. <br><br>
                       They reflect the view of adjacent lanes and areas not visible directly to the driver, aiding in lane changes, parking, and maneuvering. </p>

                    <h4>FUEL TANK</h4>
                    <p>The fuel tank is where the car stores its fuel, and placing it in the front is a common design for many vehicles.<br><br>
                       Placing the fuel tank in the front balances the car's weight distribution, improves stability, and allows for efficient fuel delivery to the engine.</p>

                    <h4>BUMPER/FENDER</h4>
                    <p>The fender or bumper is a protective component that surrounds the front and rear parts of the car, absorbing impact in collisions.<br><br>
                        It helps minimize damage to the car's body and internal components by absorbing and dispersing impact forces during minor collisions.</p>

                    <h4>WHEELS</h4>
                    <p>Wheels are the circular components on which the car rests and moves, typically made of metal or alloy.<br><br>
                       They support the vehicle's weight, provide traction for movement, and house the tires, which contribute to the car's handling and performance.</p>

                    <h4>HOOD</h4>
                    <p>The hood, also called the bonnet, covers the engine compartment at the front of the car. <br><br>
                        It protects the engine and other vital components from external elements, houses sound insulation, and contributes to aerodynamics.</p>
